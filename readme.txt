Set a minimum order amount in your WooCommerce store to be able to check out. Simple, lightweight, and effective.

== Description ==

Do you want to ensure your customers reach a minimum amount before completing an order? **Minimum order for WooCommerce** is the ideal tool for you.

This plugin allows you to set a minimum value that the cart subtotal must reach for the customer to proceed to checkout. If this requirement is not met, a clear notice will be displayed on the cart page, and the checkout process will be prevented.

**Main Features:**

* **Simple Configuration:** Adds a single option in the WooCommerce settings to define the minimum amount.
* **Clear Notices:** Messages on the cart and checkout pages to inform the user when they have not reached the minimum.
* **Full Compatibility:** Native integration with WooCommerce and compatible with most themes.
* **Optimal Performance:** Clean, lightweight code that aligns with WordPress development best practices.

== Installation ==

**Automatic Installation (Recommended):**

1.  From your WordPress dashboard, navigate to `Plugins > Add New`.
2.  Search for "minimum order".
3.  Click "Install Now" and then "Activate".
4.  Go to `WooCommerce > Minimum order` to set the minimum amount in the corresponding section.

**Manual Installation:**

1.  Download the plugin's `.zip` file from the WordPress.org repository.
2.  Unzip the file. You will upload the `minimum-order-para-woocommerce` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation.
3.  Activate the plugin from the `Plugins` menu in your dashboard.
4.  Configure the amount in `WooCommerce > Minimum Order`.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the minimum amount include shipping costs? =

No, the plugin validates the amount against the **cart subtotal**. You have the option to do this before or after applying a coupon discount.

= Can I customize the message shown to the user? =

Currently, the plugin displays a default message on the cart. We plan to offer more customization options in future versions.

= Is it compatible with my theme? =

The plugin uses standard WooCommerce hooks to display notices, so it should be compatible with any theme that follows WooCommerce standards.

= Does it affect my site's performance? =

No. The plugin is extremely lightweight, and its code only runs on the cart and checkout pages, so the impact on performance is negligible.
